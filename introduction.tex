\subsection{Introduction to Invoice}
An invoice is a document that lists the products and 
services a business provides to a client and establishes 
an obligation on the part of the client to pay the 
business for those products and services.

Invoices are the backbone of the accounting system for 
small businesses.

Invoices constitute some of the most valuable documents exchanged between business
partners, including government institutions. Companies exchange enormous number of
invoices daily, both in electronic and paper formats. The real obstacle lies on how efficiently and quickly the invoicing process is handled from order initiation to delivery and payment for goods or services. An invoice management system helps to simplify and
organise this process and thereby enhance process transparency.

The invoice management system generates, sorts and classifies invoices automatically.
It also monitors invoice status and sends notifications where necessary. Invoices are
automatically archived for the long term. With invoice management structures in place,
the quality of invoice data is improved.

Although invoices can be issued in a traditional printed format, e-invoicing provides methods of invoice transmission and processing via electronic means. The major difference
between e-invoices and traditional paper invoices is the automated process involved in
e-invoices.
